In TravelPerk, we work in “squads” which are small, autonomous teams made up of full-stack engineers, a Product Manager, and a Product Designer. As a Senior Product Designer, you’ll be part of a product trio that will help lead your squad but we also like to see our Designers contributing to the wider Design and Product functions.

What will my day look like?

Focus on UX over UI: we expect you to be really good at creating experiences. Having a Design System in place, you should have good UI skills but they won’t be your focus
Developing a partnership with your Product Manager to fully understand customer needs and business value, challenging each other to raise the bar for your product area
Be able to know when to run your own research or lean on our in-house Research team to co-ordinate usability tests, discovery sessions, or any other analysis that helps you build your experiences
Working with our data team to interrogate various data sources to uncover relevant quantitative insights
Working with our Content Design team to fine tune the message that your features are conveying
Ideating quickly and effectively with your squad, favouring communication and collaboration over ping-ponging via tools
Understanding technical constraints and opportunities through a fundamental understanding of web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JS, APIs) allowing you to communicate ideas effectively with engineers and fellow designers
Continuously optimizing the design process in your squad and across the wider team
Testing and optimizing low–high fidelity prototypes with key stakeholders and customers to iteratively validate that we are solving the right problems
Mentoring and supporting fellow designers, bringing your unique skill-set and continually raising the bar of the team and our products

What skills are required?

5+ years working for a SaaS product
Experience working with Sketch / Figma and remote workshop tools like FigJam / Miro
Being able to design for desktop but also mobile if it’s necessary
Solid communication skills (verbal and written). You are comfortable presenting ideas to multiple stakeholders and articulately defending design decisions
Ability to influence product roadmaps working alongside Product Managers and Engineers
Advocating for *Suitcase* our Design System
Regular interaction with customers and prospects to understand the problem space
A positive and proactive team player
English language skills to a professional level, both writing and speaking

Why You’ll Love Our Team
We are a team of 30 talented Product Designers, Content Designers and Researchers. We like to think of ourselves as high-achievers, goal-oriented, and eager to learn and grow. We foster efficiency through autonomy and creativity through collaboration. 
Working in the Product Design team will ensure high-quality design, strategic impact on the product and next-level GIFs 😎
In the Product Design team, you will find a strong culture of ownership, impact-over-effort and lending support to each other, there are no egos and transparency is highly valued.

In TravelPerk, we work in “squads” which are small, autonomous teams made up of full-stack engineers, a Product Manager, and a Product Designer. As a Senior Product Designer, you’ll be part of a product trio that will help lead your squad but we also like to see our Designers contributing to the wider Design and Product functions. 
As a Senior Product Designer working for the Policy & Control squad you’ll be in charge of offering a 7* experience to company admins looking for a tool that will make managing their business travel more efficient. Allowing them to have rules over company spend and empowering their teams to book their own travel. 
This role can be based from our London or Barcelona hubs and requires you to be in the office once per week, or four times per month.
What will my day look like?
Within your squad, we are looking for you to be confident in the following:

Focus on UX over UI: we expect you to be really good at creating experiences. Having a Design System in place, you should have good UI skills but they won’t be your focus
Developing a partnership with your Product Manager to fully understand customer needs and business value, challenging each other to raise the bar for your product area
Be able to know when to run your own research or lean on our in-house Research team to co-ordinate usability tests, discovery sessions, or any other analysis that helps you build your experiences
Working with our data team to interrogate various data sources to uncover relevant quantitative insights
Working with our Content Design team to fine tune the message that your features are conveying
Ideating quickly and effectively with your squad, favouring communication and collaboration over ping-ponging via tools
Understanding technical constraints and opportunities through a fundamental understanding of web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JS, APIs) allowing you to communicate ideas effectively with engineers and fellow designers
Continuously optimizing the design process in your squad and across the wider team
Testing and optimizing low–high fidelity prototypes with key stakeholders and customers to iteratively validate that we are solving the right problems
Mentoring and supporting fellow designers, bringing your unique skill-set and continually raising the bar of the team and our products

What skills are required?

5+ years working for a SaaS product
Experience working with Sketch / Figma and remote workshop tools like FigJam / Miro
Being able to design for desktop but also mobile if it’s necessary
Solid communication skills (verbal and written). You are comfortable presenting ideas to multiple stakeholders and articulately defending design decisions
Ability to influence product roadmaps working alongside Product Managers and Engineers
Advocating for *Suitcase* our Design System
Regular interaction with customers and prospects to understand the problem space
A positive and proactive team player
English language skills to a professional level, both writing and speaking

If you’re ready to take off with us, keep reading!
We’re looking for a Senior Executive Assistant to give 7-star support to our CFO. This role is ideal for someone looking to join a fast-paced company during hypergrowth, collaborate on meaningful projects, and work closely with some of the best leaders in European tech. It is not an entry-level position. You will be the eyes and ears of the executives you support, connecting organizational areas, projects, and conveying critical business information to the C-suite, ensuring meetings and materials are efficient and effective and serving as a trusted business partner to deliver against the priorities of the company. You will also coordinate and manage executive scheduling, optimising calendars to ensure that your executives are always able to focus on the top priorities. 
The dynamic nature of this role requires exemplary time management skills and the ability to identify and anticipate the executive’s needs. To perform this job successfully will require seamless interaction with a broad range of individuals including members of the Leadership Team, Board of Directors, and senior managers across the business, often handling highly sensitive and confidential information while exercising professionalism and discretion. Ideal candidates will thrive in extremely dynamic environments requiring high levels of ownership and a natural ability to get things done.
This role will be based from our Barcelona hub and, while we do offer certain flexibility, the responsibilities of the role require you to be in the office several days per week. 
What you will do:

Firm gatekeeper of executive calendars, skilfully optimising their time, while balancing conflicting priorities and prioritizing daily tasks to keep the executive’s day moving smoothly and efficiently
Manage end-to-end travel needs e.g. logistics and visas, including coordinating itineraries across multiple stakeholders
Management of executive inboxes, filtering, prioritising and actioning emails as required
Prepare, collate and distribute materials for key meetings and events as well as ensuring that logistics (such as IT) run seamlessly
Note-taking and follow-up on actions points in strategic team meetings
Core administrative duties e.g. arranging signatures, executive gifting, handling official documents and correspondence 
Process executive expenses and payment of invoices 
Act as the point-of-contact between the C-suite and internal departments
Collaborate with Extended LT, Chiefs of Staff and other EAs on projects such as event organisation, offsites, etc.
Handle confidential information, and make good judgement calls with excellent communication and tact
Prepare Powerpoint presentations as required 
Draft communications on behalf of the executives when necessary
Occasional personal tasks 

What you need:

Minimum of 10+ years experience supporting C-Level executives, ideally in high-growth tech companies.
Be a team player. We're not joking here. We need top class collaborators.
Be humble: you’re ok with the spotlight, but you don’t crave it. You know what you don’t know and you’re willing to learn.
Extreme ownership + persistent ‘get things done’ attitude to find the 3rd door and solve the unsolvable!
Exceptional organizational abilities, superb interpersonal skills, multi-tasking and prioritization skills, attention to detail and excellent time-management.
Proactive approach and able to work under pressure. Look for problems to solve before they become problems. But when they become problems, stay cool and solve them quickly.
Extremely hands-on: you don't mind solving small problems or big problems. From high-level planning to detailed execution.
Stakeholder management: people come to you because you make their lives easier and solve problems for them. However, you are able to say NO when necessary, even if it means not pleasing everyone. 
Adaptability and flexibility: with our fast-paced environment change comes all the time. This role will evolve with time and as the company scales, different needs will emerge. You must possess a genuine hunger to navigate your role in a fast-changing, hyper-growth environment.
You feel comfortable constantly being challenged, learning fast, making things happen, and moving from one task to the next.
Unimpeachable integrity: you are as trustworthy as it gets, handling sensitive information quietly and discreetly.
You’re tech-savvy and agile with G-Suite, Slack, and Notion among others, and can adapt quickly to new software tools.
Stellar communication skills (written and verbal) - you feel comfortable communicating with internal and external stakeholders, including the C-Suite and board members in an efficient and professional manner.

Assist with and run document review projects
Help accelerate the adoption of legal tech solutions across the business, building on our existing class-leading tech stack

TravelPerk is an “in real life” business.  We aim to bring together team members face-to-face as often as possible.  In relation to this role, you can operate from our hubs in Birmingham or Barcelona.  The package you receive will depend on your “home” hub.  
During our interview process, we’ll look for your ability to demonstrate specific competencies which derive from TravelPerk’s values.  These are shown in the list below. The winning candidate will have particularly brilliant responses ready in relation to the Seven Star Service attributes. 

Seven Star Service: 

Proactivity: You anticipate customer needs, and you come up with ways to accelerate business growth.  You always, always, always move at speed, and with the needs of our client and our customers as your first priority.  You can sustain delivery in a hyper-speed working environment while maintaining your own satisfaction and wellbeing. 
Accountability: You act as an owner.  You take an active role in project reviews.  You propose ways in which TK as a whole can be more effective in the future without apportioning blame.
Innovation: You do things differently.  You love innovation in problem-solving and process delivery.  You think in the future.  

We are a team: 

Collaboration: You encourage innovation within team work, and you like to challenge the status quo amongst your working group.  You work to understand  the needs and expectations of progressive in-house teams’ customers.
Honesty: You share your failures with your team. You do this to humanise failure, and to coach and increase awareness.  You communicate transparently - up, down and across - and form relationships that emphasise being direct with people in your workplace.
Communication: You enter conversations with a flexible and open mind. You're open to listening to and understanding other people's point of view, rather than simply getting your message across.

Impact over Effort: 

Prioritisation: You regularly review your workload/ manage up in order to concentrate your efforts on the most impactful matters for TravelPerk and TravelPerk mission and vision; you're realistic and don't over promise.
Organisation: You focus on the big wins. You own your workflow.
Creativity: You don’t stop communicating great ideas - you prize ambition over ease of implementation.  In seemingly intractable situations, you are able to find resolution pathways.  

Don't be an asshole: 

Continual Growth: You are ambitious to level up yourself, and to hold the people around you accountable.  You're constantly seeking new opportunities - you don't just wait for things to happen.
Curiosity: Your curiosity drives you to unpeel the layers of certain processes/products etc and work to improve them - you recognise that sometimes this may mean removing or cancelling a process.  You share your influences and inspirations amongst your peers. You nurture a sense of collaboration and cooperation amongst a team.
Integrity: You build relationships with all TravelPerk stakeholders which are trust based.  You give credit where it's due.



Where will the role take you:

We believe passionately in the importance of growth and development; and that every person in the legal team is entitled to a job from which they derive high levels of personal satisfaction.  Talented and driven people are entitled to expect employers to offer an employee value proposition which offers continual levelling up.  
A successful occupant of this role will, after a suitable period of time, have exceptional experience of working in a fast scaling, global tech (and specifically SaaS) business, and will have deep familiarity with the latest tools and techniques to deliver legal services at scale which internal partners love.  
We will support you in building a career as a lawyer (by helping you become legally qualified in England & Wales, for example) or in legal operations, if you have an interest in either or both of these pathways.  Your progress will be tracked using a development plan; and that plan will incorporate our goals for you as well as your own goals for yourself.  
The winning candidate will benefit from a positive, “high impact not long hours” culture.

If you’re ready to take off with us, keep reading. We are looking for a Legal Counsel to join us!
As Legal Counsel, Privacy (EU) at TravelPerk, you’ll support the legal and regulatory aspects of TravelPerk’s new standalone privacy function within Europe.  In doing so, you will help us build trust-based relationships with our community of business travellers, and drive value from the data we process; and you’ll help to shape and build the leading in-house legal team in tech.  
This role sits within TravelPerk’s legal team.  Reporting to TravelPerk’s Legal Manager, Privacy (Global) you will work on a wide variety of commercial, risk management and governance matters within the privacy sphere.  You’ll support on privacy strategy and strengthening company's privacy culture, enabling sales, product, marketing and other teams to increase TravelPerk's growth and drive value by having privacy as an ally, know-how and training, policy drafting and implementation, and optimisation of our approach to data processing agreements, and management of privacy queries from customers.
However, this is just the start: we’ll provide you with the resources you need to help us  consolidate a world-class data privacy and data protection culture for TravelPerk, and to grow your own profile as a leading professional in the privacy space.  
What you will do:

Be responsible and accountable for legal and regulatory privacy matters in the EU - TravelPerk is a ‘start up for grown ups’ and, so long as you adhere to our corporate values, you will be given very, very wide latitude to run things as you see fit 
Proactively and holistically identify areas of risk, and take appropriate action to proactively mitigate risk in collaboration with accountable team members
Investigate, implement and tune privacy policies, and to support business governance and compliance (including, where applicable, using a process-minded approach to work, and the latest technology, to improve the efficiency and speed-to-market of the privacy function and the legal department of which it forms a part)

Develop a close relationship with business stakeholders (particularly sales, marketing, product and security), act as a business partner to understand needs and objectives, and build privacy outcomes accordingly
Constructively support the right mind-set and educate stakeholders (including specifically employees) on the relevance of privacy matters

Using data insights and thought-leadership, help our marketing team build trust with and give confidence to business travellers regarding the processing of their data

Build relationships with stakeholders in the privacy space, including regulators in key markets
Assist TravelPerk’s security team in preparing for and managing data-related incidents, ensuring our processes are fit for purpose
Report privacy risks and advise on appropriate options/solutions to senior stakeholders

What you need:

The position requires an excellent understanding of European privacy and data protection law, the ability to understand new and complex data-related technologies, and to develop creative solutions to ensure compliance with all privacy and data protection laws globally.  It is not essential that you have a detailed understanding of US data protection/ privacy laws.
You must hold a recognised privacy qualification (such as CIPPE/E). You’ll also have experience of working in tech (and specifically SaaS) and/ or B2B sales. 
Candidates with between 5-7 PQE of experience of working in an in-house function or a law firm are likely to have the relevant skills/ knowledge for this position, but we will consider any applicants with relevant experience (and it is not essential that you have prior experience of working in-house).
During our interview process, we’ll look for your ability to demonstrate specific competencies which derive from TravelPerk’s values.  These are shown in the list below. The winning candidate will have particularly brilliant responses ready in relation to the Seven Star Service attributes. 

Seven Star Service: 

Proactivity: You anticipate customer needs, and you come up with ways to accelerate business growth.  You always, always, always move at speed, and with the needs of our client and our customers as your first priority.  You can sustain delivery in a hyper-speed working environment while maintaining your own satisfaction and wellbeing. 
Accountability: You act as an owner.  You take an active role in project reviews.  You propose ways in which TK as a whole can be more effective in the future without apportioning blame.
Innovation: You do things differently.  You love innovation in problem-solving and process delivery.  You think in the future.  

We are a team: 

Collaboration: You encourage innovation within team work, and you like to challenge the status quo amongst your working group.  You work to understand  the needs and expectations of progressive in-house teams’ customers.
Honesty: You share your failures with your team. You do this to humanise failure, and to coach and increase awareness.  You communicate transparently - up, down and across - and form relationships that emphasise being direct with people in your workplace.
Communication: You enter conversations with a flexible and open mind. You're open to listening to and understanding other people's point of view, rather than simply getting your message across.

Impact over Effort: 

Prioritisation: You regularly review your workload/ manage up in order to concentrate your efforts on the most impactful matters for TravelPerk and TravelPerk mission and vision; you're realistic and don't over promise.
Organisation: You focus on the big wins. You own your workflow.
Creativity: You don’t stop communicating great ideas - you prize ambition over ease of implementation.  In seemingly intractable situations, you are able to find resolution pathways.  

Don't be an asshole: 

Continual Growth: You are ambitious to level up yourself, and to hold the people around you accountable.  You're constantly seeking new opportunities - you don't just wait for things to happen.
Curiosity: Your curiosity drives you to unpeel the layers of certain processes/products etc and work to improve them - you recognise that sometimes this may mean removing or cancelling a process.  You share your influences and inspirations amongst your peers. You nurture a sense of collaboration and cooperation amongst a team.
Integrity: You build relationships with all TravelPerk stakeholders which are trust based.  You give credit where it's due.



Where will the role take you:

We believe passionately in the importance of growth and development for lawyers; and that every lawyer is entitled to a job from which they derive high levels of personal satisfaction.  Talented and driven people are entitled to expect employers to offer an employee value proposition which offers continual levelling up.  
A successful occupant of this role will, after a suitable period of time, have exceptional experience of working in a fast scaling, global tech (and specifically SaaS) business.  He or she will develop the tools and techniques to deliver internal privacy capability at scale which subverts the expectations of stakeholders regarding privacy law (i.e. that it is bureaucracy) and drives tangible business outcomes.  
In terms of promotions, the next layer up from Legal Counsel is Legal Manager. We are not hiring in this layer currently, and do not expect to hire “over the head” of Legal Counsel; instead, we are looking for Legal Counsel to grow and scale capability in their areas of expertise (and among global legal subject matter experts who interact with their territories).  The critical elements in your escalation to the next tier will be development of an effective “regulatory insight to product improvement” supply chain, a provable understanding of data privacy laws outside of the European Union, and a proven track record in developing people (including TravelPerk’s DPO).  
TravelPerk will offer you as much latitude as you want in order to deliver the best possible outcomes for your customers; and micromanagement/ layers of bureaucracy are not part of that process.  
The winning candidate will benefit from a positive, “high impact not long hours” culture.  

What do we offer?
