FP&A Manager,Finance,"Palo Alto, CA or San Francisco, CA",,"The Strategic Finance team at TripActions is focused on three primary objectives:

Measuring and reporting on financial performance and organizational health. The team identifies key drivers and metrics that are fundamental to driving the financial health of the business. Additionally, the team leverages technology to automate reporting. 
Shaping company priorities around value-creating activities. The team builds a deep understanding of strategic principles and how the company creates value for shareholders, customers, and partners. As a fast-moving business that’s disrupting a stale industry, it’s not always obvious where to focus first.

Supporting complex decisions and coaching others on how to use and interpret financial data. The team should serve as knowledge integrators, connecting people and data across all parts of the organization to improve decision-making. However, just as important as being the integrator is being the enabler and coach, making sure the right questions are being asked and appropriate analytical tools are being used - especially when we’re not in the room.

As an FP&A Manager your role will be critical in providing strategic financial guidance to TripAction’s R&D leadership team and planning for the future state of the business.  We are looking for a strong leader with exceptional analytical skills, an effective communicator, who is passionate about driving change in a dynamic fast-paced environment.  You will be responsible for:

Be able to build trust with stakeholders and senior leaders across the organization and drive results through soft skills, not through mandates
Have extensive competency in building and auditing sophisticated financial models and large data sets
