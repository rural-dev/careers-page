We are in the process of consolidating the functionality of 9 systems from 3 different companies.  The target system will need to keep track of the status of Collision Centers for 16 Car Manufacturer’s Collision Center Certification programs.  The process and questions for each certification program can differ in terms of who is responsible for doing various aspects of the certification and the data needed for the certification.   One of our existing systems is the target system, but there is a lot of missing functionality and the system handles the certification in a different manner to the other systems and needs to be updated to be able to support the needed functionality of the other systems.
