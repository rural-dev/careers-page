Founded by former Workday clients, we value partnership and engagement as a cornerstone of our business. With years of functional and technical experience in all phases of Workday's deployment life cycle, we can determine and the most efficient integration designs and rapid deployment strategies. We develop maintainable solutions and provide support for integration testing and updates for new Workday releases.
Intecrowd is a boutique, global consulting company looking to expand its presence in Europe by setting up a team in Poland. Our work is client facing consulting around the implementation and operations of a Human Resource and Financial Information System called Workday. We are a Workday Certified Services Partner, and have a strong reputation for delivering high quality work. We are looking for software developers and business analysts to help design, build, and test integrations with Workday. Project managers and functional consultants in Human Capital Management, Financials, Global Payroll, and Absence and Time Tracking are also desired. Exposure to Workday is preferred, but not required. Training and certification will be provided. People with a variety of applicable career experience levels will be considered, and compensation will be commensurate with that experience. Written and spoken English language skills are required. 
Integration consultants meet with client stakeholders (remotely or in person) to define requirements for integrations that move data between various enterprise software systems. These requirements are captured in design documents, which are then used to develop the code in a service oriented architecture using proprietary tools. XML and XSLT are the primary development skills to interact with SOAP and ReST based web services, while Java, MVEL, NodeJS, Python, Linux and AWS are secondary technical skills. Integration consultants also conduct unit testing, support broader testing initiatives, migrate code, and assist with system cutover tasks.
Successful candidates will have most of these qualifications:

Comfortable or fluent speaking English
Good English writing skills
Strong customer services attitude
Friendly in person demeanor
Ability to tactfully ask detailed questions and remember the answers
Ability to lead a meeting through an agenda
Ability to think logically
Strong desire to learn
